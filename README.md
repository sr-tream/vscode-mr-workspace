Add colored borders for folders in workspace on:

- panel (disabled by default)
- statusbar (disabled by default)
- tabbar (on top by default)



Color may be specified by setting `vscode-mr-workspace.color` in folder settings (`ConfigurationTarget.WorkspaceFolder`)





\*In workspaces with one folder this extension does nothing.
